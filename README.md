# PatientManagement
CRUD application for the Patient Management using Angular 11, .NET WEB-API, and SQL.

To run an application, open the PatientManagementUI project under Visual Studio Code, open the PatientManagementWebAPI project under the Visual Studio 2019. SQL files can be used to create the Tables and Stored Procedures and I have used SQL Server Management Studio 2018, and the database name is SQL_PM_DEV_03.
To run the project, Run the WebApi project first then run the UI project.
